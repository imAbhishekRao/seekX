# Features

## 🔎 Search Installed Applications

Start typing the name of an installed application and seekX will instantly show matching results.

Example:

```
firefox
code
discord
```

---

## 📁 Search Directories

Use `/` before a path to search directories directly.

Example:

```
/bin
/usr
/home
```

---

## 📄 Search Files

Use `//` to search files in the system.

Example:

```
/image.png
/document.pdf
/script.sh
```

---

## 🌐 Web Search

seekX always provides an option to search your query on the web.

Even if:

* the app exists in the system
* the file exists in the system

you can still choose to **search the same query on the web**.

---

## 🌍 Smart URL Detection

If the query looks like a URL, seekX automatically opens it in the **system's default browser**.

Example:

```
google.com
github.com
```
